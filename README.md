# transmission_line
the code calculates first the Resistance, Inductance and
Capacitance per phase of a 3 phase Transmission Line system.
The user must be first asked to input the conductor resistivity, conductor length, and
conductor diameter. Next, the user will be asked to choose whether the transmission
system is symmetrical or unsymmetrical. For symmetrical spacing, only one distance will
be given, but for unsymmetrical spacing, the distance between phases will be given.
After calculating R, L and C parameters, the user will calculate the ABCD constants based on the
line length entered in Task 1. For a medium line length, the user will be asked whether the model
is Ï€ or T. Finally,
The user will choose between CASE I and CASE II. For any case, the user will be asked to input
the receiving end voltage.
CASE I: After calculating the ABCD constants, if the receiving end load is 0.8 pf lag with active
power varying from 0 (no load) to 100 kW (full load),
CASE II: After calculating the ABCD constants, if the receiving end power is 100 kW but with
power factor varying from 0.3 lag to UPF and from 0.3 lead to UPF.
